# Energy & Waste Disposal Analysis

This project analyzes the interplay between energy consumption and waste disposal using real‑world datasets and data science techniques. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that inform sustainable practices and environmental policy.

## Features & Highlights

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis  
- Visualizations (charts, trends, comparisons) to reveal relationships  
- Reproducible workflow using Python, Jupyter Notebook  

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)  
- Jupyter Notebook for integrated code + narrative  
- (Optional) Exported visual files or dashboards
